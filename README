*Feelings* is a tumble-log written in Rails, but built to take advantage of the schema-less design of CouchDB.

Getting up and running is simple:

1) Download Feelings:

git clone git://github.com/paulca/feelings.git

2) Edit config/couchdb.yml if you need to

3) Fire up CouchDB

4) Fire up the Rails app:

script/server
